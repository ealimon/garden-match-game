# 🌷 Garden Match Memory Game

A simple, high-contrast, and beautiful memory matching game designed specifically for older adults and seniors (like a 78-year-old mother!).

This project prioritizes:
* **Clarity:** Large text and icons (emojis) for easy viewing.
* **Simplicity:** A friendly 4x4 grid and clear gameplay loop.
* **Accessibility:** High color contrast and easy click targets.
